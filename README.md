# Unity Meta + Asset Migrator

### Special Thanks

* [notnotnotswipez](https://github.com/notnotnotswipez) - Thank you for writing the original!
* Fersy - Thank you for testing!

### DISCLAIMER!
This is a rewrite + extension of https://github.com/notnotnotswipez/PrefabConverter to Rust!
All credit goes to notnotnotswipez for his original implementation.

### What is this?
Ever had files from one Unity project you wanted to migrate to another?
Usually you'd export a package, but this isn't ideal when exporting giant amounts of assets!

Asset migrator helps solve that problem by resolving meta files for you and copying data properly!
